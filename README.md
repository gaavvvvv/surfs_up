# Overview
W.Avy wanted to see if the weather would be nice enough to run the business year round from the summer to winter. I gathered the data on the temps in June and December which showed that for the most part it would be decent weather for surfing and ice cream year round. There are times when it gets quite cold in December, however.

# Results
On average the temperature in June is about 74.9 degrees fahrenheit, with a minimum temperature of 64 and a max of 85. While that's a 20 degrees difference, 3/4 of the time the temperature will be 73 degrees and up. Pretty great surfing and ice cream weather if you ask me. 

Looking at the average temperature in December, 71 degrees fahrenheit, we're not far off from the June average. The minium is about 5 degrees lower than the June minimum reaching 59 degrees, which is quite cold. I certainly wouldn't want to get in the water or enjoy some frozen dairy then. However, the max temp in December, 83, is pretty close to the June max. We also see that 3/4 of the time, the temperature in december is 69 degrees and above which is still pretty warm. 

# Summary
All in all the temperatures aren't too drastically different between June and December leading me to believe that the business would fare well throughout the year. Some other quereies that I'd consider performing to gather more data would be on the preciptation and wind. If it's too windy, it may be too dangerous for surfing and if it's raining a lot, that might dampen the experaince of eating ice cream. Once more information is gathered regarding other climate variables, it'd recommend full sail ahead with the business.
